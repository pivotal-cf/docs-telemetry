## <a id='v1.2.0'></a>v1.2.0

This release is a major feature improvement of our collection mechanism, resolving the largest failure mode: having staged changes on the foundation.

* Allowing Staged Changes
    * Does not fail to collect when there are staged changes present on the foundation
    * Collects from a new endpoint in pending changes to understand which products are deployed and which are staged
    * Warns when staged changes are present detailing which changes are staged and how they may affect reporting
* Update packages and dependencies
* Minor improvements
